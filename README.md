# udacity_p7_d3_titanic
As a part of the mandatory Data Analyst Nanodegree curriculum. A data visualization project on D3.js using the Titanic Data Set


a README.md file that includes four sections...

# Summary

The data set has been extensively used by data analysts to build predictive models on the survivability of passengers. The visualization intends to help the reader analyze the distibution of passengers across key variables like gender, age, and passenger class. The interactivty feature around double clicking on passengers travelling together (having the same ticket number) helps the reader identify the relations between the co-travellers (parent-child, spouse, siblings, matrons, etc) and make assumptions on why some people survived and others didn't.

# Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback

# Feedback - include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

# Resources
The visualization is inspired by Sarah Spijkers' photoshop rendered visualization using the same data set (http://sarahspijkers.com/DataVis.jpg).
